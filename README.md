C++ with Visual Studio Code!

This repository contains all my C++ projects developed with VS code.
It includes, but is not limited to, "blank": my testing project.

"blank" is, as i said, my testing project. It's nothing but a single (or multiple) file(s) where
I test out code sections. Its content will vary wildly.

The Matrixinator is an utility I made for my assistant Joshu in his laboratory endeavors.
Its main purpose is to predict 8 specific values (the octagon) from a similarity tree/matrix in each sample.
